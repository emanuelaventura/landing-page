## HTML & CSS

I used the HTML and CSS styling provided by Udacity.

## Dynamic behaviour

A `dynamic navigation menu` is created from the sections present.

I added a button before each section to make them `collapsable`.
When the page is loaded, for default, only section1 is open, the others are all collapsed.

When a section is in the viewport, it becomes `active` and the relative navigation link too.

When the user clicks a nagigation menu link, the page scroll smoothly to the relative section. If this section was collapsed, it is opened.

When the user scrolls below the fold of the page, a `scroll-back-to-the-top button` becomes visible
